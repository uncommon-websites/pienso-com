        "Pienso allows us to use call data in a way we could not before. Listening to a lot of calls is not fast nor scalable.
        <br><br>
        With Pienso, we understand the themes emerging from a high volume of calls, with much less time and effort, and with less subjectivity and more acuity using the Pienso topic-scoring model.
        <br><br>
        And the topic scoring model gets better as we evolve it. It's made it easier and faster for us to answer questions."
